To create a personalized training plan for you, I'd love to learn more about:\n\n- Your current running experience and fitness level\n- What goals you're working toward (race distance, time goals, general fitness, etc.)\n- How many days per week you can train\n- Any injuries or limitations I should know about\n- What type of training you enjoy most\n\nWhat would you like to focus on first?",

      "content": "Great! A 5K focus with 6 days per week is perfect for building speed while managing injury risk. Since you're injury-prone, we'll emphasize the **Foundation** pillar heavily - mobility, prehab, and recovery work.\n\nBefore I create your athlete profile and first training plan, a few quick questions:\n\n- What's your current 5K time (or recent pace you can hold for 20-30 minutes)?\n- What types of injuries have you dealt with before?\n- Do you have access to a gym, or prefer bodyweight/home workouts?\n- Any specific days you prefer for harder workouts vs. easier days?\n\nOnce I know this, I can create your athlete profile and today's training plan. We'll structure your week with 3-4 run days, 2 lift sessions, and daily foundation work to keep you healthy and progressing toward that faster 5K!",

Let me ask about those other details so I can create your profile and get you started:\n\n- What types of injuries have you dealt with before? (knees, IT band, plantar fasciitis, etc.)\n- Do you have access to a gym, or prefer bodyweight/home workouts?\n- Any specific days you prefer for harder workouts vs. easier days?\n\nWith a 19:42 5K, we'll be targeting workouts around 6:00-6:30 pace for speed work and 6:45-7:15 for tempo efforts, with easy runs much slower. The injury prevention focus will be key to consistent training!",

We'll make glute strengthening and hip stability a major focus.\n\nStill need to know:\n- Do you have access to a gym, or prefer bodyweight/home workouts?\n- Any specific days you prefer for harder workouts vs. easier days?\n\nWith your injury history, I'm thinking:\n- Daily foundation work (hip openers, glute activation, calf/achilles care)\n- 3-4 run days with careful progression\n- 2 targeted strength sessions focusing on glutes, hips, and lower leg stability\n- Extra emphasis on post-run recovery protocols\n\nOnce I know about gym access and your weekly schedule preferences, I can create your athlete profile and today's plan!",

One gym session plus home workouts with dumbbells, step, and pullup/dip bar gives us great options.\n\nLast question - any preference for which days you like harder workouts vs easier days?

Given your injury history, we'll start conservatively with:\n\n- Daily foundation work targeting your trouble spots\n- 3-4 run days with careful volume progression  \n- 1 gym session + 1 home strength session per week\n- Lots of glute activation, hip stability, and lower leg care\n\nSound good?",
